# Unity in Action — Third Edition  
## Applied Project Repository (Joseph Hocking)

This repository is a **practical Unity project** built alongside the study of  
**_Unity in Action, Third Edition_** by **Joseph Hocking** (Manning Publications, 2022).

The goal of this project is to **apply the concepts explained in the book directly inside Unity**, translating theory into working systems, scripts, and scenes.

This repository is intended as a **learning and experimentation space**, not as a finished commercial game.

## Purpose of this repository

This project exists to:

- reinforce understanding of Unity’s architecture
- practice C# scripting inside a real Unity project
- apply component-based design instead of relying on premade scripts
- build confidence moving from general programming to game development

The repository follows the **spirit and progression of the book**, implementing systems as they are introduced and explained.

## What the book teaches (and what this repo applies)

Based on *Unity in Action, Third Edition*, this project covers and demonstrates:

### Core Unity concepts
- GameObjects and Components
- The Unity Editor workflow
- Scene setup and hierarchy organization
- Inspector-driven configuration

### Programming with C#
- Writing custom scripts instead of click-together behavior
- MonoBehaviour lifecycle (`Start`, `Update`)
- Public vs private variables
- Frame-rate independent logic using `Time.deltaTime`

### Player and character systems
- Characters that move, collide, and respond to input
- First-person and third-person movement logic
- Mouse look (yaw and pitch separation)
- Keyboard-based movement (WASD)

### 3D and 2D gameplay foundations
- 3D coordinate space (X, Y, Z)
- Local space vs world space
- Transforms and rotations
- Basic physics and collision handling

### Game genres explored in the book
While this repository focuses on **early chapters and foundational systems**, the book as a whole covers:

- 3D first-person shooters
- Third-person action games
- 2D card games
- 2D side-scrolling platformers
- Enemy AI scripting
- User interface design
- Audio and spatial sound
- Networking basics
- Deployment to desktop, mobile, and web platforms
- AR and VR toolkits

Future expansions of this repository may reflect later chapters.

## What you can see in this project

Opening the project in Unity, you will find:

- A simple 3D environment built from primitive geometry
- A controllable first-person player
- Mouse-based camera look
- Keyboard movement with collision
- Gravity-based walking instead of flying
- Clear separation between:
  - camera control
  - movement logic
  - physics interaction

All systems are intentionally kept **simple, readable, and explicit**, mirroring the book’s teaching approach.

---

## Design philosophy

This project follows the same philosophy promoted by *Unity in Action*:

- **composition over inheritance**
- small, focused components
- behavior built step by step
- understanding systems before optimizing or polishing

Visual quality and assets are secondary to **clarity and learning**.

---

## Unity version

Developed using a modern Unity version with C# scripting.  
All concepts remain aligned with the principles taught in the Third Edition of the book.

---

## Status

This repository is a **work in progress** and evolves alongside continued study of the book.

It represents a learning journey rather than a final product.

---

## About Unity

Unity is a powerful, beginner-friendly game engine that handles rendering, physics, input, and deployment, allowing developers to focus on gameplay, graphics, and user experience.

With C# scripting and a vast ecosystem of tools and components, Unity enables programmers to transition naturally from application development to game development.
